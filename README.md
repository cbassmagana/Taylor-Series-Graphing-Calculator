# My Personal Project - Taylor Series Graphing Calculator

## About this Project

This application calculates and graphs the Taylor Series approximations of different polynomial equations. It is a very helpful tool in Calculus 1, 2 and 3 for completing homework questions,
visualizing solutions, and building a better understanding of mathematical concepts. Although it is
quite a straight-forward program, there are no popular equivalents of this application available online.

To best use this application: enter the coefficients of your polynomial of interest when prompted -- now observe the GUI for the resulting graph(s) and the console for the corresponding equation.
